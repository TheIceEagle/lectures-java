## Packages and Classes

The Java programming language is a high-level language that can be characterized by all of the following buzzwords:
* Simple
* Object oriented
* Distributed
* Multithreaded
* Dynamic
* Architecture neutral
* Portable
* High performance
* Robust
* Secure

Java language was developed by James Gosling and Henry McGilton.

In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the .java extension. Those source files are then compiled into .class files by the javac compiler. A .class file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes â€” the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine1 (Java VM). The java launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the Java Virtual Machine.

Java has a philosophy of WORE (Wright Once Run Anywhere), due to that, java became insanely widespread around the globe. More than 4 billion devices right now are working on jvm.

```java
package org.example.day2;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Let's go to example DemoPackage.java.
